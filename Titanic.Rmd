# Introduction
Want to do some prediction stuff using machine learning in R. Will mess around in an Rmd here, then go through the same things in python through a kaggle kernel.

# Data

load the data, take a quick look. Make a couple plots.

```{r}
train<-read.csv('titanic_train.csv')
str(train)
```
