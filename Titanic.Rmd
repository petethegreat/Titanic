# blah

Have a random forest in kaggle. Want to reproduce that here, tidy it, then upload as a script and publish.
This should just do that random forest, and create the test predictions for submission

# Also

do another model, svm or something

# Stacking and Ensembling

Start some stack/ensembling stuff in just python
write some helper functions and stuff. output predictions
Tidy this and put it in a script/Rmd



# Introduction
Want to do some prediction stuff using machine learning in Python, using scikit-learn. Will get things sorted here, and then upload this to kaggle as a script


# setup

```{python}
import numpy as np 
import pandas as pd 

from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
import matplotlib
import seaborn as sns

plt.rcParams["figure.figsize"] = (12,12)

```

load data, take a quick look

```{python}

data = pd.read_csv('titanic_train.csv')
print(data.head())
print(data.describe())
print(data.describe(include=['O']))
```
